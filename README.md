However, it should run for other such matches too. Only 10 first balls have been considered. But that can be extended to the whole game.
The final video creating all the highlights have also been generated.

The code has been written in a Jupyter-notebook which uses Python3.
The libraries that were used are:
skvideo(pip3 install sk-video), matplotlib and numpy.
